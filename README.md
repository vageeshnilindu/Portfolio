## 📖 About The Project

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This is my first step into web development as I prepare to start my Computer Science degree. This website acts as a central hub for my future projects, resume, and contact information.

It features a modern, responsive design with a dedicated **Dark Mode** for better accessibility and a functional contact form.

### ⚙️ Development Workflow (Hybrid Approach)
This project represents a modern workflow, combining manual coding with AI assistance:
* **Structure & Logic (HTML/JS):** Manually hard-coded image paths, links, and the script logic to handle the Dark Mode toggle.
* **Design (CSS):** Leveraged "Vibe Coding" (AI tools) to generate the CSS layout, which I then directed and tweaked to match my personal preferences.
* **Services:** Integrated Web3Forms to handle backend email functionality without a server.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* **Responsive Design:** Looks great on both desktop and mobile.
* **Dark Mode 🌙:** A manual toggle to switch between light and dark themes.
* **Contact Form:** Fully functional email form powered by Web3Forms.
